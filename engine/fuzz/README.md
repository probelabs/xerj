# Fuzz harnesses

libFuzzer targets for the parsers an untrusted request reaches. CI builds and
runs all of them on every push and pull request — see the `fuzz` job in
[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml), which is just a
wrapper around [`.github/scripts/fuzz-smoke.sh`](../../.github/scripts/fuzz-smoke.sh).

## Running them

```sh
rustup toolchain install nightly
cargo install cargo-fuzz --locked

# exactly what CI does: build every target, replay every seed, explore for 20s each
bash .github/scripts/fuzz-smoke.sh

# a real campaign
FUZZ_SECONDS=3600 bash .github/scripts/fuzz-smoke.sh

# one target, interactively
cd engine && cargo +nightly fuzz run query_string
```

Crashing inputs land in `fuzz/artifacts/<target>/`; re-run one with
`cargo +nightly fuzz run <target> fuzz/artifacts/<target>/<file>`.

## seeds/ vs corpus/

`fuzz/seeds/<target>/` is tracked; every file is named after what it covers and
is a regression case. `fuzz/corpus/<target>/` is the working corpus and is
**gitignored** — `cargo fuzz run` writes every input it finds interesting there,
and a few hundred opaque blobs per run is how a seed corpus stops being
reviewable. `fuzz-smoke.sh` copies the seeds in before each run.

To promote a discovered input (a crash, or a case that reached something new),
copy it into `seeds/<target>/` under a descriptive name.
`seeds/date_math/regression-207-overflow-hours` is the first one: it is the
input libFuzzer minimised the `TimeDelta::hours out of bounds` panic down to.

## The targets

| target | entry point | why it is untrusted |
|---|---|---|
| `query_dsl` | `xerj_query::parse_request`, `rewrite` | the whole `_search` body: nesting depth, clause count, sort and `_source` specs |
| `query_string` | `xerj_query::parse_query` on `query_string` / `simple_query_string` | the hand-written Lucene grammar, also reachable via `?q=` — ES's CVE-2023-31419 was a stack overflow here |
| `date_math` | `xerj_query::dates` | `"gte": "now-1d/d"` and `"format": "…"` are caller-supplied; both compile through hand-written tokenisers |
| `sql` | `xerj_engine::sql::parse_sql` | `/_sql` takes a statement from the wire; ES's CVE-2024-43709 was an OOM from a crafted SQL query |
| `painless` | `xerj_engine::painless::{check_script_limits, eval_painless}` | attacker-supplied *code* inside a query body, plus the depth/op/deadline budgets that are supposed to bound it |
| `index_name_date_math` | `xerj_engine::index::resolve_date_math` | `<logs-{now/d}>` arrives in a request URI — a second date-math implementation with its own brace scanner |

This list is the coverage. It is not every parser in the engine, and the
security docs must name these rather than claim the parser surface generally —
that overstatement is what [#207](https://github.com/xerj-org/xerj/issues/207)
was filed about.

## Adding a target

1. Write `fuzz_targets/<name>.rs` and add the matching `[[bin]]` to `Cargo.toml`.
2. Seed `seeds/<name>/` with real, *valid* inputs. A target with no seeds
   starts from the empty input and reaches almost nothing in a bounded run.
3. Nothing else — `fuzz-smoke.sh` discovers targets with `cargo fuzz list`, so
   CI picks it up automatically, and
   `xerj-engine/tests/security_tooling_claims.rs` fails if the harness or its
   seeds are missing.

## Conventions

- Harnesses cap their input length. The engine's own caps are larger; the
  smaller bound here keeps the fuzzer's budget on grammar states instead of on
  the length check that rejects everything past it.
- Prefer the uncached entry point when a memoising wrapper exists. Driving
  unique keys through a bounded cache measures its eviction policy, not the
  parser.
- Harnesses must stay deterministic and free of I/O: no files, no sockets, no
  clocks that change the control flow.
