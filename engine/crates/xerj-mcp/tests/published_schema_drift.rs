//! Drift guard: the published MCP tool schema vs the tools the server serves.
//!
//! `landing/docs/agents/schemas/mcp-tools.json` is what an agent reads to find
//! out what XERJ's MCP server can do. It was hand-written, and it drifted: it
//! advertised **six** tools while the binary served **ten**, missing every
//! `xerj_brain_*` tool. Nothing compared the two, so nothing failed — the file
//! simply told agents a smaller, wrong story for as long as it existed.
//!
//! The file is now generated from a live `tools/list` response
//! (`scripts/mcp-schema-check.sh --write`), and this test pins it to
//! [`xerj_mcp::tool_specs`], the function that response is built from. Adding,
//! renaming, or re-describing a tool fails here until the published schema is
//! regenerated. That is the point: the failure is cheap, and the silent
//! divergence it prevents is not.
//!
//! Scope note: this test covers the library that both binaries serve from. The
//! end-to-end path — build the real binary, speak JSON-RPC over stdio, diff the
//! wire response against the file — is `scripts/mcp-schema-check.sh`, wired
//! into CI next to the MCP smoke test.
