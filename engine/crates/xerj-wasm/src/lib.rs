//! # xerj-wasm
//!
//! Pluggable transform pipeline for xerj.
//!
//! Provides a trait-based plugin system for document transformation at ingest
//! time.  Built-in plugins (field rename, drop, add, JSON parse, timestamp
//! parse, PII redaction, grok, route) are always available as native Rust
//! code.
//!
//! A real WASM backend (via `wasmtime`) can be wired in later behind the
//! `wasm` feature flag without changing any public API.
