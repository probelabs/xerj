//! Process-wide, event-driven WAL fsync scheduler (issue #334).
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! `wal_sync = "batched"` promises that a write reaches the platter within
//! `wal_batch_ms`.  The first implementation of that promise (RC4 W1 #9)
//! gave **every `IndexStore` its own OS thread** that slept `wal_batch_ms`
//! and then asked each of its WAL shards "are you dirty?".  On a node
//! holding many indices that is a thread and a timer per index whether or
//! not anything was ever written to it.
//!
//! Measured on a real node built by `xerj autoindex` over the reference
//! corpora (the workflow this repo documents), idle, zero client
//! connections, byte-identical data dir across the whole sample window:
//!
//! ```text
//! indices                 9 382
//! threads                 9 709   (~1 per index)
//! RSS                     7.98 GB
//! CPU                     718-760 %   (10 samples over 2.5 min)
//! ctx switches / s      ~197 000
//! interrupts / s        ~142 000
//! ```
//!
//! Nothing was being fsynced in any of that: the answer to "are you dirty?"
//! is always "no" on an idle index.  The cost was pure scheduler overhead,
//! and because it is *latency* overhead (timer wakeups, cache-line churn)
//! rather than throughput, it made the whole machine feel unusable.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Wake on writes, not on a clock:
//!
//! * one **bounded** pool of worker threads for the whole process, sized
//!   from the core count — never from the index count;
//! * the pool is spawned **lazily on the first dirty WAL shard**, so a node
//!   that never takes a write has zero fsync threads;
//! * a WAL shard enters a min-heap keyed by *its own* deadline
//!   (`write_instant + wal_batch_ms`) the moment it goes dirty, and leaves
//!   it as soon as it has been fsynced;
//! * an index with no writes since its last fsync holds no thread, no timer
//!   and no heap entry — it costs nothing;
//! * when the heap is empty the workers block on a condvar, so an idle node
//!   generates **zero** wakeups.
//!
//! # Prior art (reference-coding, CLAUDE.md mandate)
//!
//! Retrieved from the `xerj-storage` corpus before writing this:
//!
//! * **sled** — `sled/src/db.rs:80` `fn flusher(...)` plus
//!   `sled/src/config.rs:81,99` (`flush_every_ms`, default 200 ms): sled
//!   runs **one** flusher thread per `Db`, and every tree inside that `Db`
//!   shares it.  The unit of periodic durability is the *database*, not the
//!   keyspace.  XERJ's bug was making it the index.
//! * **fjall** — `fjall/src/worker_pool.rs:41-118`: a fixed-size worker
//!   pool (`pool_size`) serves *all* keyspaces through one `flume` channel,
//!   and workers block in `rx.recv()` (`worker_pool.rs:130`) until a
//!   `WorkerMessage` (`Flush`, `RotateMemtable`, `Compact`) is pushed by a
//!   keyspace that actually has work.  Idle keyspaces cost nothing.
//!
//! Approach adapted, no code copied (both are Apache-2.0/MIT, so copying
//! would have been permitted; the shapes differ enough that it wasn't
//! useful).  The one deliberate divergence from both: XERJ's deadline is
//! per shard and anchored to the write that dirtied it, because
//! `wal_batch_ms` is a documented per-write durability bound, whereas
//! sled's `flush_every_ms` is a free-running tick.
//!
//! # Durability
//!
//! A shard is armed inside `WalWriter::mark_dirty`, i.e. under the shard
//! mutex, on the same code path that made the bytes dirty — every present
//! and future append path is therefore covered by construction.  The
//! scheduled fsync happens at `arm_instant + wal_batch_ms`, so the
//! power-loss window is bounded by `wal_batch_ms` **measured from the write
//! itself**, which is at least as tight as the old free-running timer.
//! `Strict`/`sync` (fsync inline before ack) and `Async` (never fsync) do
//! not register a handle at all and are untouched.
