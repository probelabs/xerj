//! Issue #465: a node that could not bind a listener must not claim it did.
//!
//! Before the fix the three listeners were bound inside `tokio::spawn`s that
//! ran *after* the banner, and a bind error there was `error!`-logged and
//! explicitly non-fatal. A node whose ES-compat port was already held by
//! another process therefore printed the full success banner — that port, this
//! data directory, `Started in {ms}` — and then stayed up serving nothing on
//! it, because `tokio::join!` returns only once all three tasks end.
//!
//! The consequence is not cosmetic. The process that *does* own the port
//! answers `GET /_cluster/health` with `green`, which is the readiness probe
//! the docs prescribe, so `xerj autoindex` proceeds and streams the user's
//! corpus into a datastore they have never heard of and cannot name. Three
//! agents hit this independently in a field study; one wrote 905 files —
//! contracts, invoices, a bank export — into a stranger's data directory and
//! got `ok=true exit=0` for it.
//!
//! These are process-level tests because the defect is invisible from inside
//! the config crate: every value was valid, the machine simply said no. The
//! first two hold a port for real and assert the binary dies; the third holds
//! nothing and asserts it still lives, so a binary that refused to start for
//! any unrelated reason cannot pass this file.
