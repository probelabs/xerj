#!/usr/bin/env bash
# landing-constants-guard.sh — fail when the website's hand-duplicated constants drift.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   landing/ is plain static HTML with no build step, so every published constant
#   (ES-YAML conformance count, canonical-operation count, release version, the
#   kNN exactness claim) is copy-pasted across dozens of files. A 2026-08-12
#   first-contact agent study found FOUR different conformance figures live on the
#   site at once, a page headlining "SEVEN canonical operations" whose own card said
#   "six", version footers frozen three releases back, and three machine-readable
#   schema files that nothing linked to. Individually cosmetic; collectively they
#   cost trust on a site whose entire pitch is verified numbers — and agents read
#   whichever copy they land on first.
#
#   Findings: demo/playbooks/FTX_PROBE_2026-08-12.md
#
# HISTORICAL CAPTURES ARE ALLOWED, BUT MUST SAY SO
#   Pages that publish a dated captured run (demo/index.html) legitimately carry an
#   old number — rewriting it would falsify a real measurement. Mark those with an
#   inline HTML comment immediately before the figure:
#
#       <!-- snapshot:YYYY-MM-DD -->1305 / 1329
#
#   and state the current value nearby in prose. The marker is what distinguishes
#   "deliberately historical" from "nobody updated this".
