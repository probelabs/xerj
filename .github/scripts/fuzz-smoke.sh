# Build and exercise every libFuzzer harness in engine/fuzz.
#
# This is the script CI runs, so a contributor can reproduce the gate exactly:
#
#     rustup toolchain install nightly
#     cargo install cargo-fuzz --locked
#     bash .github/scripts/fuzz-smoke.sh
#
# It does two things, and the second is the one that matters on a pull request:
#
#   1. builds every target with AddressSanitizer + libFuzzer coverage, so a
#      harness cannot silently rot into "does not compile";
#   2. runs every target for FUZZ_SECONDS over its checked-in seeds, which both
#      replays known-interesting inputs as a regression suite and spends the
#      remaining budget on new mutations.
#
# Seeds live in engine/fuzz/seeds/<target>/ and are tracked. The working corpus
# in engine/fuzz/corpus/<target>/ is NOT: libFuzzer writes every input it finds
# interesting there, and committing a few hundred opaque blobs after each run is
# how a seed corpus stops being reviewable. Seeds are copied in before each run;
# promote a discovered input by copying it into seeds/ under a name that says
# what it covers.
#
# A crash, a sanitizer report, an OOM, or a single input slower than
# FUZZ_TIMEOUT fails the job, and the offending input is written to
# engine/fuzz/artifacts/<target>/ for CI to upload.
