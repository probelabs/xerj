"""CLA check for Co-authored-by trailers (issue #269).

cla-bot resolves signatures by matching commit *authors* against
.contributors. When a maintainer re-lands a fork PR — squashing the
contributor's commits onto an xerj-org branch and crediting them with a
Co-authored-by trailer — every commit author is xerj-org, so the gate goes
green even though the person whose work it is has never signed (live
instance: PR #248, the re-land of buger's #166). This check closes that
hole: every Co-authored-by trailer on a PR must resolve to a login listed
in .contributors.

An email resolves to a login by, in order:

 1. GitHub noreply address — ``[id+]login@users.noreply.github.com``.
 2. This repo's own commit history — ``GET /repos/{repo}/commits?author=<email>``
    returns the login GitHub itself attributes that email to. The CLA
    signature flow ("open a PR adding your username to .contributors from
    your own account") lands a commit authored with the signer's email, so
    signing makes the signer resolvable as a side effect.

Anything unresolvable FAILS the gate, deliberately: an identity the gate
cannot attribute is exactly what it exists to flag.

Field-report carve-out (issue: the agent field-report loop was dead)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A pull request whose ENTIRE diff is agent field reports — new markdown files
under ``user-feedback/16-agent-field-reports/`` and nothing else — is exempt
from this trailer gate. That folder is documentation of the *experience* of
using XERJ (see its README and https://xerj.org/llms.txt); requiring a CLA to
add one file there is exactly the friction that kept the folder empty. The
exemption is deliberately narrow: it needs every changed path to be a
field-report ``*.md``, so bundling any code, CI, or other-docs change with a
field report re-arms the full gate — a mixed PR must never slip a code change in
under a field report. ``README.md`` in that folder is NOT a field report and
does not qualify. See :func:`is_field_report_only`.

Usage (CI):
  check_cla_coauthors.py --pr <number> [--changed-files "<paths>"]
    Runs the trailer gate. If --changed-files is a field-report-only set, the
    gate is skipped (exempt) and this exits 0 without a network lookup.
  check_cla_coauthors.py --is-field-report-only --changed-files "<paths>"
    Prints nothing; exits 0 iff the paths are a field-report-only set, else 1.
    Used by the separate CI job that provides `verification/cla-signed` for
    strictly field-report-only pull requests.
  Needs `gh` and GH_TOKEN for --pr; repo comes from GITHUB_REPOSITORY or --repo.
