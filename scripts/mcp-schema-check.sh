# mcp-schema-check.sh — pin the PUBLISHED MCP tool schema to the REAL binary
# =============================================================================
# `landing/docs/agents/schemas/mcp-tools.json` is what an agent reads to learn
# what XERJ's MCP server can do. It was hand-written, and it drifted: it
# advertised six tools while the binary served ten, missing every xerj_brain_*
# tool. Nothing compared them, so nothing failed.
#
# This script is the generator AND the gate. It boots the MCP server over
# stdio, issues a real `tools/list` JSON-RPC request, and either diffs the
# response against the published file (default) or writes it (--write).
#
# No XERJ node is required: `tools/list` is answered locally, before any
# proxying. That keeps this cheap enough to run on every CI push.
#
#   ./scripts/mcp-schema-check.sh            # check — non-zero on drift
#   ./scripts/mcp-schema-check.sh --write    # regenerate from the binary
#
# Environment:
#   XERJ_BIN   path to the main `xerj` binary (default:
#              engine/target/release/xerj). The server is driven as
#              `xerj mcp`, i.e. exactly the path an installed user has.
#   XERJ_MCP_BIN
#              path to the standalone `xerj-mcp` binary. If set, it is driven
#              instead, with no subcommand argument.
